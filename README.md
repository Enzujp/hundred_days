This web application is being built to help people document and log their coding journeys- whether it be starting out as a newbie or learning a new language.

Hundred days of code lets you add on as many languages as you want to learn (although two at a time is the recommended quantity), and users would have a segment when logged in, where they can add notes about their progress and later on a chat segment would be added where users can communicate with each other and share ideas- or build communities.

The "Language" app folder holds most of the essential files, with the "Core" app containing boilerplates and structural HTML code. Within the Language app, is the Cart.py file which controls the adding, removal, and updating of Language(s) which users might want to learn.

Finally, the "Userprofile" app contains usercontrol logic, allowing for signups, signin, and containing access to User accounts, where they can see their Language(s) and progress.

This has been a solo project, but help is welcomed on the front-end.
